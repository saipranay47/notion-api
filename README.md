# Notion-Next.js Integration Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) to fetch data from a Notion database and display it on a website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Using the Notion API
--------------------

This project uses the Notion API to fetch data from a Notion database. You will need to set up a Notion account and obtain an API key to use it.

You can learn more about how to use the Notion API in their [official documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started).

Deploy on Vercel
----------------

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
